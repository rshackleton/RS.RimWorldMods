# [RS] Improved Disassembly

![Supports RimWorld 1.1](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=RimWorld&message=1.1&color=orange&style=flat-square)

Fighting mechanoids, especially with mods such as Combat Extended, is dangerous!

This mod aims to improve the rewards from disassembling the mechanoid corpses to compensate for that.
